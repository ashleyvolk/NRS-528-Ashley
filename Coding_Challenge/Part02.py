# 2. Push sys.argv to the limit
# Construct a rudimentary Python script that takes a series of inputs as a command from a bat file using sys.argv,
# and does something to them.

# The rules:
# Minimum of three arguments to be used.
# You must do something simple in 15 lines or fewer within the Python file.
# Print or file generated output should be produced.

# countdown = 100
#
# while countdown > 0:
#     print ('CountDown = ', countdown)
#     countdown = countdown - 5
