# Final Toolbox Coding Challenge
### This toolbox contains the three tools, the select tool, the clip tool, and the buffer tool.
* The select tool is used to select for an area of Rhode Island in which you want to make the study area (can be either a town or county in Rhode Island)
* Then you use the clip tool to clip the lakes and ponds layer to the study area you created with the select tool.
* After this you use the select tool again and select for lakes and ponds that are larger than a specified amount that the user decides on. 
* Following this you use the buffer tool and set a distance around the lakes and ponds layer to set a buffer distance around these areas. 
  * The buffer tool helps to show the areas surrounding the lakes and ponds which could cause harm to these areas such as gas stations, large freeways, parking lots, etc.

#### The example data is zipped in this folder for testing.
