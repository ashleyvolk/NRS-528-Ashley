### I am currently a senior at URI studying Environmental Science and Management.
* I am very interested in GIS and want to explore python to further my skills.
* I have had two internships over the past two summers in which I worked with GIS.
  * The first summer I worked with GIS to create a model in which we could create orthomosaics over water to study water bird distribution.
  * The second summer I worked with GIS to understand the changes in aquifer volume from the years 2000 to 2018.
### *Things I Enjoy:*
* Cooking
* Baking
