# 1. List values
# Using this list:

# [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]
#
# Make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python (you do not need to append to a list just print the output).

# Task 1: multiple lines of code
# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]
# for number in my_list:
#     if number < 5:
#         print(number)
#
# # Task 2: One line of code
# x = [number for number in my_list if number < 5]
# print(x)



# 2. List overlap
#
# Task 1: Determine which items are present in both lists.
# list_a = ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'hamster', 'gerbil']
# list_b = ['dog', 'hamster', 'snake']
# def common (list_a, list_b):
#     return list(set(list_a) & set(list_b))
# present_items=common(list_a, list_b)
# print(present_items)

# Task 2: Determine which items do not overlap in the lists.
# list_a = ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'hamster', 'gerbil']
# list_b = ['dog', 'hamster', 'snake']
# not_overlap = []
# for items in list_a:
#     if items not in list_b:
#         not_overlap.append(items)
# for items in list_b:
#     if items not in list_a:
#         not_overlap.append(items)
# print(not_overlap)


# 3. Given a singe phrase, count the occurrence of each word
# Using this string:
# Count the occurrence of each word, and print the word plus the count
# (hint, you might want to "split" this into a list by a white space: " ")

# Task 1:
# string = 'hi dee hi how are you mr dee'
# def word_occurrence(str):
#     count = dict()
#     words = str.split()
#     for word in words:
#         if word in count:
#             count[word] += 1
#         else:
#             count[word] = 1
#     return count
# print(word_occurrence('hi dee hi how are you mr dee'))


# 4. User input
# Ask the user for an input of their current age,
# and tell them how many years until they reach retirement (65 years old).

# # Hint:
# age = input("What is your age? ")
# retirement = 65 - int(age)
# print ("Your age is " + str(age))
# print ("Your retirement year is in " + str(retirement) + "year")



# 5. User input 2
# Using the following dictionary (or a similar one you found on the internet), ask the user for a word,
#     and compute the Scrabble word score for that word (Scrabble is a word game, where players make words from letters,
#     each letter is worth a point value), steal this code from the internet, format it and make it work:

# score = {"a": 1, "c": 3, "b": 3, "e": 1, "d": 2, "g": 2,
#          "f": 4, "i": 1, "h": 4, "k": 5, "j": 8, "m": 3,
#          "l": 1, "o": 1, "n": 1, "q": 10, "p": 3, "s": 1,
#          "r": 1, "u": 1, "t": 1, "w": 4, "v": 4, "y": 4,
#          "x": 8, "z": 10}
# def word_score(word):
#     total = 0
#     for i in word:
#         total = total+score[i.lower()]
#     return total
# 
# print(word_score("green"))
